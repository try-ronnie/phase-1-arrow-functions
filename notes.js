//note that arrow functions dont neeed curly brackets .... and if so ... if the block of code to be run by the function is just a single expression even the curly brackets are not really need ...
const funct = (parameter1 , parameter2) => parameter1 + parameter2
// automatically the arrow function will put the syntax its self and even auto return the value gotten from the expression 
// this logic still works for the parameter...funct. if one parameter is passed then theres no need to add brackets
const func = x => x*x
